## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##2 - Create an R Markdown document and do the following (include the R code in all of your answers):
##2.a. show the step-by-step how to solve the following system of equations in R (Use R chunks to run each part). 
## 2x + 5y = 33
## x + 3y = 19
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(2,1,5,3), nrow=2, ncol=2)
x
y <- matrix(c(33,19), nrow=2, ncol=1)
y
solve(x,y)
```
##2.b.Create a vector that goes from 1 to 100 and calculates the average of it WITHOUT using the R function “mean”.
```{r}
A <- c(1:100)
A
average <- sum(A)/100
average
```
##2.c.Install the package “dplyr”.
```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
```
##3 - create a data frame of two rows with A, B, C, and D in row 1 and D, E, F, and G in row 2.
```{r}
ROW_1 <- c("A","B","C","D")
ROW_1
ROW_2 <- c("D","E","F","G")
ROW_2
DATA_FRAME <- rbind(ROW_1,ROW_2)
DATA_FRAME
```
